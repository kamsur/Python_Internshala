# Python_Internshala
Internshala training project

The final project under this training was a Python application with PyQt5-based GUI. The application was a fantasy cricket game where users can create virtual teams from a given set of players using limited number of points. Each such team can then be made to compete with other teams and depending upon pre-defined number of skill points of each player, the team with highest number of points won a match.
